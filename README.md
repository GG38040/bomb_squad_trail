## 🎖️ In Tribute on Memorial Day

This project is more than a game – it’s a salute to the courage, sacrifice, and legacy of the United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) community.

On this Memorial Day, we honor the heroes who’ve served, the teammates who made the ultimate sacrifice, and the families and friends who carry on their legacy. _We remember, and we celebrate the spirit of service._

## 🎮 About Bomb Squad Trail

_Bomb Squad Trail_ is a retro-inspired video game in the tradition of Oregon Trail, putting you in the boots of a Navy EOD team. Travel through challenging terrain, face tense scenarios, and learn about the people who keep others safe by taking on the world’s most dangerous jobs.

We built this as a fun way to bring people together to learn about Navy EOD’s history, achievements, and sacrifices – and to keep their stories alive.
